%Functions written by Bruce for Expt .mat files:
%
% PlotExpt       Plots mean rates as a function of relevant parameters
%                (deduced from filename)
% PlotRates      Plots mean rates as a function of user-specified parameters.
%
% autocorrelate  Calculates autorcorrelation function of spike
%                trains.
%
% CalcDDI        Calculated DDI for a disparity tuning expt.
%
% trigsdf        Calculates spike density function/PSTH
%
% GetNames       Build name of other expt files from the current
%                filename (e.g. find SF tuning data that goes with
%                disparity tuning).
%
% subsample      averages values in groups to shorten a
%                vector. (Handy to make PSTHs of different binwidths)
%
% famp           calculate spectral power at one frequency.
