Seems to me that it should be easy to sort out whats going wrong with Rayleigh test on the raw data. There are only two steps - calculate the vector length, and do the resampling. Maybe the error happens when I turn the smoothed distribution into anlges, which would generate an error in vector length.

I get a vector length of 0.637. If I generate more angles from the distribution I get 0.455 which may be closer to the truth?

This is based on one complete circle being 200 of your units, and that the distribution was made from 1000 samples. Right?

Assuming all this is true, then the only question his how often a uniform distribution generates r > 0.455, which I have at 46 times per 1000, so p < 0.046.

So, where do we differ.
